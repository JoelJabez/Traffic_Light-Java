<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>So far, the information on which roads are part of the road junction means nothing to a driver and does not help users to control traffic. Let's add the road's state and timing information to each of the elements.</p>
<p>In this stage, we will finish our traffic management system. The last task will be to add more important information to all the elements in the queue. Each time when the road's name is printed in the system mode, make sure to also output its state (<code class="java">open</code>/<code class="java">close</code>) and calculate the time, until this road closes/opens. Here is an example of system information output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">! 11s. have passed since system startup !
! Number of roads: 4 !
! Interval: 3 !

Road "First" will be closed for 2s.
Road "Second" will be closed for 5s.
Road "Third" will be open for 2s.

! Press "Enter" to open menu !</code></pre>
<p>It might be difficult to understand how this system should work, so here is a brief <strong>explanation </strong>with examples:</p>
<p>In the example above, the <em>Third </em>road is the open one and in 1 second it must close because the <em>First </em>road will open. The <em>Second </em>road will open after the <em>First </em>one will be closed - 3 seconds (<code class="java">interval</code>) after the <em>First </em>one opens.</p>
<p>The time for each road should be calculated before the information is displayed, so if a road is deleted, the time for the other roads will change. Let's say we've just deleted one road from system. The next output (after 1 second) will be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Road "Second" will be closed for 1s.
Road "Third" will be open for 1s.</code></pre>
<p>There is no intermediate state between road state changes, so the next output (after 1<strong> </strong>second) should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Road "Second" will be open for 3s.
Road "Third" will be closed for 3s.</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, the time for other roads will change when adding roads. Let's say we've just added a <em>Fourth</em> road to system. The next output (after 1 second) will be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Road "Second" will be open for 2s.
Road "Third" will be closed for 2s.
Road "Fourth" will be closed for 5s.</code></pre>
<p>Let's continue exploring our example in corner cases. If the opened road is deleted, there should be no roads in state <em>open </em>until the next one opens. Let's say we've just deleted two roads from system (sequentially). The next output (after 1 second) will be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Road "Fourth" will be closed for 4s.</code></pre>
<p>If the only road that exists is the opened one - it should never close (it's state should be always "open"), but still should count down the time to close. </p>
<p>Also, you might want to make your program more user-friendly and beautiful. You can achieve it by adding color to the output â€” green, yellow, and red with these ANSI color codes:</p>
<p>ANSI_RED = <code class="java">"\u001B[31m"</code><br/>
ANSI_GREEN = <code class="java">"\u001B[32m"</code><br/>
ANSI_YELLOW = <code class="java">"\u001B[33m"</code><br/>
ANSI_RESET = <code class="java">"\u001B[0m"</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">System.out.println("\u001B[32m" + "Hello World!" + "\u001B[0m");</code></pre>
<p>The snippet above will give you <code class="java"><span style="color: #ff4363;">Hello World!</span></code></p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Your task for the final stage will be to add the road's state and timing information to each of the elements in <strong>System mode</strong>. Add the <code class="java">open</code>/<code class="java">close</code> substring, according to it's state and calculate the time, until this road switches to another state. </p>
